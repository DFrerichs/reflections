When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would definitely want to use a remote repository when I am working with a team of programmers on a specific project. I would also want to use it when jumping from computer to computer if I was working from more than one location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
