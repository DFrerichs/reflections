When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would definitely want to use a remote repository when I am working with a team of programmers on a specific project. I would also want to use it when jumping from computer to computer if I was working from more than one location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I would want to have control over the branch I was working on. If someone else was working in that branch and committed changes to the remote repository, an automatic pull could destroy what I may have been working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks exist in GitHub, not the local repository. They are clones that exist on the server. Clones go from the remote repository to the local computer. Branches consist of successive individual updates to the file that you're working on. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I would think that having an up-to-date version of a remote branch would reduce conflicts with any collaborators working with me on a project. Too much diversion, say in a program or HTML/CSS update, could send the project in an unintended direction. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaboration without using Git or GitHub would have to be relegated to personal interaction with the other party, perhaps with e-mailed changes that I think would slow the entire process down. I've even seen entire web pages torn down, starting over from scratch because of bad collaboration. I've also seen multiple directories of the same thing simply because of the confusion that results from not using version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
