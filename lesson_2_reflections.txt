What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, Git creates a .git (hidden) subdirectory within that directory as a repository. This saves snapshots of the projects within that directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	To my understanding, the staging area is a "holding" area prior to files being commited to the repository. The staging area allows limited commits to be made so that logical changes can be stacked according to overall groupings.
